        <h3>⭐ Sara — A-Level Chemistry (Leicester, 2025)</h3>
        <p>"I’ve been taught by Chris for 8 months now - I feel I have greatly improved in my exam technique and found better ways to learn content. Chris is a great teacher who adapts each lesson to his students based on their needs and doesn’t move forward until you have understood the lesson. I wouldn’t have enjoyed learning chemistry this much if it wasn’t for his unique teaching style. It’s nice having a teacher that is supportive and pays keen attention to all his students. Thank you Chris!"</p>
        
        <h3>⭐ Hollie — Parent of GCSE Maths & Science Student (Leicester, 2025)</h3>
        <p>"Chris has been tutoring my daughter since she was in year 9. She is currently in year 11 and about to sit her gcses. Chris has been incredibly helpful, encouraging and patient. He has provided tutoring with Maths, Physics and Chemistry. Thanks to Chris, my daughter's grades have improved from grade 4s to 6, 7 and 8 respectively. I would definitely recommend Chris as he is a great tutor, very knowledgeable and goes above and beyond."</p>
        
        <h3>⭐ Kiran — A-Level Chemistry (Leicester, 2025)</h3>
        <p>"I've had an amazing experience being tutored by Chris; He has a unique teaching style — he adapts his lessons to the specification and explains everything in simple, clear terms that actually make sense. He’s incredibly patient and always takes the time to make sure I fully understand before moving on. Thanks to him, I’ve gained so much confidence in Chemistry and my exam technique has improved massively, especially when tackling tricky exam-style questions. Chris is both friendly and professional — exactly the kind of tutor you’d want. I’ve seen a huge improvement in my performance since starting lessons with him, and I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend him to anyone."</p>

        <h3>⭐ Evie — GCSE Maths (Leicester, 2022)</h3>
        <p>"I am currently a first year Law student. Chris was my maths tutor for just over a year until I took my GCSEs. With Chris' help, I went from scoring a 4 in year 10 mocks to achieving a grade 6 (only 4 marks off a grade 7!) at GCSE. Chris always encouraged me, explained problems clearly (better than my maths teacher) and when I finally sat my exams, I was confident and happy to sit the papers. I wouldn't have received a grade 6 without him!"</p>
        
        <h3>⭐ Fizza — A-Level Chemistry (Leicester, 2019)</h3>
        <p>“When I first met Chris, I was really struggling to understand the concepts in Chemistry — especially the maths-based questions and organic mechanisms. I’d only got a B in GCSE Maths, and my A-level Chemistry teacher was certain I’d only get a C. That really knocked my confidence. After the first paper, I started to panic and felt completely derailed. But Chris never gave up on me. From February to June in Year 13, he supported me every step of the way — always explaining things clearly, helping me rebuild my confidence, and even making me say ‘I am a champion’ in every lesson!”</p>

        <p>“I still remember how shocked and proud I felt when I found out I’d got an A in Chemistry — I’d proved my teacher wrong and beaten my own expectations. My mum was over the moon, and I’m now studying Optometry at my dream university, Aston. I’m so grateful for everything Chris did for me. I even recommended him to help a friend’s son, because I knew he’d be in the best hands too.”</p>
