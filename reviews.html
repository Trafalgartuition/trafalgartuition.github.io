        <h3>⭐ Fizza — A-Level Chemistry (Leicester, 2019)</h3>
        <p>“When I first met Chris, I was really struggling to understand the concepts in Chemistry — especially the maths-based questions and organic mechanisms. I’d only got a B in GCSE Maths, and my A-level Chemistry teacher was certain I’d only get a C. That really knocked my confidence. After the first paper, I started to panic and felt completely derailed. But Chris never gave up on me. From February to June in Year 13, he supported me every step of the way — always explaining things clearly, helping me rebuild my confidence, and even making me say ‘I am a champion’ in every lesson!”</p>

        <p>“I still remember how shocked and proud I felt when I found out I’d got an A in Chemistry — I’d proved my teacher wrong and beaten my own expectations. My mum was over the moon, and I’m now studying Optometry at my dream university, Aston. I’m so grateful for everything Chris did for me. I even recommended him to help a friend’s son, because I knew he’d be in the best hands too.”</p>
