  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    After understanding how the area of a triangle is calculated, we now turn to the next shape: the <strong>trapezium</strong> — a quadrilateral with one pair of parallel sides.
    The formula for area is:
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="katex-display">Area = (h / 2) × (a + b)</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    It’s the kind of formula that gets tossed onto a formula sheet and memorised without much thought. But what justifies it? Why do we include the factor of a half? And why do we need to add the two bases together? In this post, we will break down two different proofs – and give the respect it deserves.
  </p>

  <h2>Set-up</h2>
  <p>
    Here is an example of a trapezium, properly labelled with parallel sides <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>, and a vertical height <em>h</em>. We’ll prove the formula in two ways:
  </p>

  <h3>Trapezium Area Formula:</h3>
  <p><span class="katex-display">Area = (h / 2)(a + b)</span></p>

  <h3>Case 1: Split into Two Triangles</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Divide the trapezium into two triangles.</li>
    <li>Each triangle has height <em>h</em>, and bases <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>.</li>
  </ul>

  <pre><code>
Area = ½ h a + ½ h b
     = ½ h (a + b)
     = (h / 2)(a + b) ☐
  </code></pre>

  <p>Notice that the last line doesn't change much, but keeps everything more visual and algebraic.</p>

  <h3>Case 2: Subtract a Triangle from a Rectangle</h3>
  <p>Visually, you can imagine a trapezium as a rectangle where a triangle has been sliced off the side.</p>

  <pre><code>
Area = a h - ½ (a - b) h
     = h [a - ½(a - b)]
     = h [a - ½a + ½b]
     = (h / 2)(a + b) ☐
  </code></pre>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Two methods, one formula — and a better grasp of <em>why</em> it works.
    The more tools you have, the more you have available to tackle a new problem, and the sharper your problem-solving skills become over time.
