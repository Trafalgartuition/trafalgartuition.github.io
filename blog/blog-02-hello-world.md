# Hello, World!

Welcome to Trafalgar Tuition — an idea born from my own frustrations as a student. I remember the feeling clearly: the penny had dropped far too late in sixth form to get the grades I wanted, and it felt too late to turn things around. My chemistry teacher had said previously, "work harder." My maths teacher (and the whole class too) laughed when I said I wanted an A. He told me it would never happen... and sadly, he was right.

My tutoring journey began with one student who had been written off in the same way — predicted no better than a C in Chemistry.

This site is a work in progress, like all good things. I'm building it as a home — a one-stop shop — for everything I wish existed when I was in sixth form, and when I first started teaching: proper resources, honest blog posts, clear explanations that don’t just tell you *what*, but *why*.

You’ll find maths and science lessons, revision tools, deep dives into tricky topics, and reflections on modern education that go beyond buzzwords and exam hacks.

Studying doesn’t have to be miserable; it can be empowering, even enjoyable, when you understand the *why*.
A bad grade doesn’t define your worth. Growth does.
If you're ready to rebuild, rethink, or just to try again, then you’re in the right place.

*As someone who was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome in my late twenties, I can honestly say that I knew something was different when I was 17. It was years before I received a formal diagnosis, but deep down, I had always felt like I didn't quite fit the mold. Over the years, I've learnt that my path, like everyone elses, is unique and it is about finding out what works for you and growing at your own pace. I'm here to help you discover that.*
