(Part of the FTSE Series: Formulae Teachers Should Explain)

## Motivation

In many classrooms today, teachers face a difficult balancing act; between managing behaviour, keeping lessons moving at pace, and meeting the demands of exam boards, it's often necessary to focus purely on how to use a formula â€” rather than why the formula makes sense in the first place.

This isn't because teachers don't know the deeper logic behind formulas.
In reality, most teachers understand it very well â€” but the pressures of a busy, noisy classroom, the need to manage and differentiate for a mixed-ability classroom, and the urgent demands of finishing the syllabus mean that sometimes the journey to the formula is sacrificed for the sake of simply getting to the answer.

When you're faced with:

- Disruptive behaviour,

- Pupils who struggle with basic numeracy,

- Students battling low motivation, confidence, or difficult home lives,

you have to choose your battles carefully. Explaining the full derivation of a formula sometimes just isn't realistic when you have to get 30 teenagers through a timed exam and meet performance targets set by school leadership teams, where the pressure often falls back on the classroom teacher.

That's where the **FTSE Series** comes in! 

**Formulae Teachers Should Explain** is a project to take a step back â€” to show students (and curious minds) that most formulas are not magic, but logical outcomes of simple ideas and clear definitions.

The goal is simple:

- To rebuild some of the missing bridges between intuition, logic, and the final formula 
- To make maths make sense, not simply just be memorised.

## So Letâ€™s Begin!

In maths, some facts feel so obvious that we almost forget they need proving;take the area of a rectangle, for example. It's usually introduced as a postulate â€” something we accept without proof:

    Area of rectangle = base Ã— height

Because it's so simple, we might overlook the deeper ideas it unlocks â€” like understanding the area of a triangle.

This idea can seem so obvious that it hardly feels worth questioning â€“ but questioning is exactly what builds a deeper understanding.

### Desmos Interactive

To explore this visually, I've made a Desmos interactive here:
ðŸ‘‰ [**Try the widget**](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/7l5dxfudnr)

What youâ€™ll notice:

- A rectangle can be split into two identical triangles by drawing a diagonal.

- Each triangle is exactly half of the area of the rectangle.

- That's why the formula for a triangle is:

    $$
    \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
    $$

But there's something even more interesting:

If you drag the top point of the triangle around (in the Desmos widget), youâ€™ll notice the triangle changes shape â€”

- The sides tilt and stretch.
- The triangle "sits flat" on the x-axis.
- But the area stays the same, as long as the base and orthogonal height stay the same.

The Key Idea:
- Base = the flat side along the x-axis.
- Height = measured at a right angle from the base to the top point.

No matter how the triangle bends, as long as we use the correct base and the vertical height, the area is always:

$$
Area = \frac{1}{2} Ã— base Ã— height
$$

## What About Squares?

Now let's look at an even simpler case: the square.

In a square, the base and the height are the same. That means the area becomes:

$$
    \text{Area} = \text{base} Ã— \text{base}
$$

or more neatly:

$$
    \text{Area} = \text{base^2}
$$
(read as "base squared")

Example:
If one side of a square is 5 units long, the area is calculated as:
$$
    \text{Area} = 5Â² = 25
$$

## Perimeter vs Area

It's important to remember:

- Area measures how much space a shape covers (2D space).
- Perimeter measures how far you would walk around the edge.

For a rectangle:
$$
    \text{Perimeter} = 2 Ã— (\text{base} + \text{height})
$$

For a square (where all sides are equal):

$$
    \text{Perimeter} = 4 Ã— \text{side length}
$$

Example:

- A square with side 5 
    - Area = 25 unitsÂ²
    - Perimeter = 20 units

Understanding both area and perimeter is crucial for solving real-world problems â€“ from building, designing, and even basic budgeting.
## Working Backwards: Division and Roots

If finding the area is easy, what if we work in reverse? For rectangles, if you know the area and one side, you can divide to find the missing side.

For squares, you can go a step further: you can find the side length by taking the square root of the area.

### Example:

A square has an area of 49 unitsÂ², the side length, $l$, would be:
$$
    l = \sqrt{49} = 7
$$

## Whatâ€™s Next?

This post is just the beginning of the FTSE Series.

Next time, weâ€™ll look at the formulae of a trapezium â€” and how slicing it into triangles helps explain why the formula works intuitively!
