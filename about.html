    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I didn’t plan to become a tutor — I became the tutor I once needed.</p>

    <p>When I was a student, I struggled with direction. I was dealing with undiagnosed Asperger’s, battling depression, and tying my self-worth to exam results that didn’t reflect my potential. It wasn’t until Year 13 that I began to understand revision — and by then, it felt too late.</p>

    <p>That experience shaped everything I do as a tutor today.</p>

    <p>I now teach GCSE and A-Level students in Maths, Chemistry, Physics, and Biology. I support aspiring medics, resitters, and those who just need someone to believe they can do it. I break problems down, ask thoughtful questions, and use humour, mnemonics, and clarity to make learning click.</p>

    <p>I also create my own blog, exam-style questions, and study packs — especially focused on the maths inside science. My mission is to help students not just pass, but <strong>believe</strong> in themselves. And to prove that it’s never too late to turn things around.</p>
