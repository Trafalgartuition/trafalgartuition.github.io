    <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
      My name is Chris, and this is my personal tuition website.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’ve been working in private tuition since 2016, with over seven years of experience. This site reflects not just my work, but also my own interests and philosophy of lifelong learning — because education doesn’t stop when the final exam ends. I believe in finding new ways to think, explain, and explore problems. This is a space to show how I think and how I teach.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm also a proud advocate and mentor for students who identify as neurodivergent. I was diagnosed with Asperger’s Syndrome at 26, and I understand what it means to learn differently — the power of being understood, and the frustration when you're not.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here, you'll find a growing collection of resources I've made for my students — and for anyone else who stumbles across this site on the web.
    </p>

    <p>
      Why did I become a tutor? Because my own education felt like it was just plodding along. I was too capable to be given extra support, but not "bright and gifted" enough to be pushed or challenged. I ended up figuring things out on my own — and it took far too long to get things right the first time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Looking back, I wish I’d had the kind of mentor I try to be today — someone who truly sees their students and helps them unlock what they’re capable of.
    </p>

    <p>
      It gives me real joy to see people live up to their potential. I hope this site helps you do the same.
